Promotes Eliot Institute among Unitarian Universalists, their friends 
and families. 

Builds community through awareness of the Eliot mission, 
attendance at Eliot camps, and through participation in leadership 
opportunities. 

Annually reviews and amends the Communications Marketing Plan. 

Implements the plan using tactics that will increase the numbers 
of new campers at Eliot, assure maximum numbers of current campers 
re-register for future Eliot camps, and help the existing Eliot community 
understand and support any changes made to camp activities and policies 
by the Eliot Board or Registrar.
