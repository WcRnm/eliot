# Location of Camps

## Seabeck, Washington

Eliot Camps are held at the Seabeck Conference Center, 
located in the town of Seabeck, Washington, on Hood Canal. 
Seabeck was a busy logging town and seaport more than a century ago.

The Meeting House, built in 1857, was once the Mess Hall 
for the mill and community center. Today it serves as an 
auditorium on the Conference Center grounds. The bell that 
once called the mill hands to meals now calls campers to 
meals and services. Many of the houses built by early pioneers 
have been converted into guest lodging.

The town includes the general store across the road, a pizza 
stand, a marina (currently closed for repair), and an espresso stand.
