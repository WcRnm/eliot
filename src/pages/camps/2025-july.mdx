### Program Description

Explorations in community music, creativity and well-being. Can singing, dancing and playing together make us healthier 
individuals contributing to a healthier society?

### Bio

Lea Morris was born in Washington, DC to a father who toured the world playing trumpet in a funk band and 
a mother who dreamed of opera. Lea began singing in the Baptist church as soon as she could speak. 

In high school, she taught herself acoustic guitar by writing songs and then embarked on an exchange year in Germany. 
Lea and her compositions have earned many accolades, including Best Vocalist, Best Recording, and Songwriter of the Year.

Having shared the stage with luminaries including Odetta and Mavis Staples, Lea is returning to her 
roots with multi-layered chants and a community singing project in Braunschweig, Germany, where she currently resides.
