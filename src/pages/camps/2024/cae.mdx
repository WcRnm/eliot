# Creative Arts Eliot 2025: Your Choice of Workshops

Please join us for an amazing creative experience in a relaxed, 
non-judgemental atmosphere! You'll get to choose a workshop from 
the workshop options listed below!

Campers are placed in workshops in the order they register, so, 
don't delay! Go to our homepage and click on the Big Blue Button 
to register for Creative Arts Eliot! We'll let you know when 
the workshops are announced (and they'll be posted here!) and 
you'll get to pick what sounds fun and interesting to you.

## Kids at CAE

Children at least 11 years old are welcome to participate in the workshops.

CAE tends to attract an older crowd, so we don't always have a children's 
program for younger kids. In order to make sure we have time to recruit staff, 
we ask that kids under 11 years old are signed up at least 6 weeks prior to camp. 
(For 2025, that's June 28th.) Children CAN register after this point, 
but we may not be able to accomodate them in a children's program; parents 
will be responsible for their supervision. If you've got questions about 
the CAE children's program, or the deadline has passed and you want to 
bring your young kids to camp, please email the registrar at 
registrar@eliotinstitute.org

Children under 11 years old may partipate in workshops, if the workshop 
presenter, child, and parent are in agreement! If your kid wants to be 
in a workshop, please email the registrar to find out if this will be ok.
