# Meals at Eliot


Most people love meals at Seabeck, which are served family-style in the 
dining room. Seconds are usually available. When arranged before camp starts, 
the Seabeck kitchen can provide four alternatives to the regular, omnivorous menu: 

1. vegetarian
2. vegan 
3. no dairy
4. no gluten. 

Make your requests through the Eliot Registar. 

At check-in you will receive a “special diet” card which your server 
will ask for at each meal. It is important not to eat special meals 
prepared for others. If you need something, please ask, the kitchen 
staff can be very accommodating. 

A refrigerator in the dining room area is available for those who 
bring food for special diets or to accommodate children’s preferences. 

No K.P. duty is required on the part of campers.
