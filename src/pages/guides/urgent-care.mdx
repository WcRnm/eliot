# Urgent Medical Care

In case of emergency, call 911 and then notify the Seabeck office in person or phone 360-830-5010. 

First Aid supplies are available in the Inn Lobby, children's program areas, and on the 
swim dock (during summer). Fellow campers who have volunteered for First Aid 
assistance will be identified at the all-camp orientation on the first day. 

During summer swim times, a staff member at the lagoon usually has an air horn 
and 911 cell phone for emergency use. 

For additional assistance, ask an Eliot staff member.
