### Workshop Description

Slow down to notice, reflect and record your thoughts and observations in a nature journal.  

In this relaxing workshop, no previous skills are necessary to learn a variety of simple 
and fun creative techniques for capturing and celebrating nature in a sketchbook.  

Participants will use pencils, pens, watercolors and other materials to draw, 
paint and write in a way that is joyful and process-oriented.  

Each day will offer new techniques, prompts and inspiration for students to use 
in their own personal nature journal.
