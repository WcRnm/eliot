### Workshop Description

Do you enjoy playing tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, 
but are tired of using bare plastic figurines? 

Are you a sculptor 
wanting to add color and depth to your creations? 

In this workshop, weâ€™ll learn how to use acrylic paints to breathe 
life into three-dimensional miniatures, starting with the basic steps to 
paint your first miniature, and moving up to skills and techniques used by 
the masters of realist painting. 

This is a workshop for everyone, from beginners who have never touched 
a paintbrush, to traditional painters looking to transfer their skills 
to the third dimension, or even experienced modelmakers and miniature 
painters who want to hone their craft.

### Biography
