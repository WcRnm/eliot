# Who Comes to Eliot?

People young and old come to Eliot, from infants to seniors. Most are from Unitarian 
Universalist churches in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon.

Our camps are fully accessible to campers of all physical abilities.

Usually 20 or more churches will be represented. Some people come in extended 
family groups as large as 12, including non-church members. Many others come as singles. 

The summer conferences usually have around 250 participants and can be as high as 40% children and youth. 

Winter Eliot is especially popular with young adults. Most campers have attended in the past, 
but there are always newcomers as well.
